synopsis:       The GHC compiler's view of the GHC package database format
description:    This library is shared between GHC and ghc-pkg and is used by
                GHC to read package databases.
                .
                It only deals with the subset of the package database that the
                compiler cares about: modules paths etc and not package
                metadata like description, authors etc. It is thus not a
                library interface to ghc-pkg and is *not* suitable for
                modifying GHC package databases.
                .
                The package database format and this library are constructed in
                such a way that while ghc-pkg depends on Cabal, the GHC library
                and program do not have to depend on Cabal.
